 *  A purely functional synchronization primitive which represents a single value which may not yet be available. <p>
 *  When created, a Deferred is empty. It can then be completed exactly once, and never be made empty again. <p>
 *
 *  Deferred can be used in conjunction with Ref to build complex concurrent behaviour and data structures like queues and semaphores.<p>
 *  Note: The blocking (described below) is semantic only, no actual threads are blocked by the implementation.

   *  The loser one will raise an error when trying to complete a deferred already completed and automatically be canceled by the IO.race mechanism, thatâ€™s why we call attempt on the evaluation.
